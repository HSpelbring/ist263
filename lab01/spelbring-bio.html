    Hello! My name is Hayden Spelbing, and I am from Richmond, Virginia. I am currently a senior at Syracuse University, majoring in Computer Science, with a strong interest in pursuing a career in the cybersecurity industry, specifically in red teaming. My passion for cybersecurity extends beyond the classroom, and I enjoy learning about various hacks and exploring the broader aspects of cybersecurity. This curiosity has driven me to hone my skills in various coding languages and actively seek out opportunities that challenge and expand my knowledge in the field.
    One of my proudest accomplishments was working on a project where my team and I created a functional and visually appealing Mechanic CRM, which we showcased at the Engineering Fair for prospective students. In addition, I have gained hands-on experience working as a CMMC policy auditor and red teamer at a government contracting company called Probity in Washington, D.C., where I spent two summers applying my skills in real-world settings.
    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am a big fan of documentaries and enjoy watching mystery movies and horror films. I also have a soft spot for comedies and enjoy unwinding with a good laugh. When Iâ€™m not working or studying, I like to spend my free time skiing whenever I have the chance.
    As I approach the end of my time at Syracuse, I am excited about the opportunities ahead in the cybersecurity field and look forward to continuing to learn and grow within this dynamic industry.
