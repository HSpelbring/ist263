            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I developed a deep passion for technology, problem-solving, and 
                competition. I attended the Collegiate School, where I spent much of my time balancing academics with 
                playing soccer, a sport I dedicated many years to and that shaped my teamwork and discipline.
            </p>

                Drawn to Syracuse University for its strong computer science program and opportunities to pave my 
                own path, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Throughout my time at Syracuse, I 
                worked on a variety of technical projects, took on leadership roles, and built meaningful connections. I 
                was an active member of Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity, where I served as Vice President of New Member 
                Development, organizing events and mentoring incoming members. Additionally, I worked as a PepsiCo 
                brand ambassador, engaging with the student community to promote the brand and its products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the summers, I gained valuable industry experience through two internships at Probity Inc., where 
                I worked on cybersecurity initiatives, as well as data and policy analysis. These experiences, combined 
                with my academic coursework, solidified my interest in cybersecurityâ€”particularly in offensive security 
                and red teaming. I am actively pursuing opportunities in penetration testing and adversarial security, 
                aiming to apply my skills in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments, and security research.
